# definitelynotmyidea : my custom theme for Pelican

This is my custom theme for the static site generator [Pelican](https://blog.getpelican.com/), forked from the default "notmyidea" theme, which was itself inspired by [Smashingmagazine](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2009/08/04/designing-a-html-5-layout-from-scratch/).

As you can see this is *definitely* not my idea.
